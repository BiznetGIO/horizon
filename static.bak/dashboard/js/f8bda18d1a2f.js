The primary difference between a\n    container and these other file system concepts is that containers cannot be\n    nested. You can, however, create an unlimited number of containers within\n    your account. Data must be stored in a container so you must have at least\n    one container defined in your account prior to uploading data.\n  </p>\n</div>\n");}]);
